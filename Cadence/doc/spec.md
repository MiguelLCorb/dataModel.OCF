- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `cadence[number]`: This Property describes the rate at which a cyclist is pedalling/turning the pedals  - `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity  - `dateCreated[date-time]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform  - `dateModified[date-time]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if[array]`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource  - `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n[string]`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name[string]`: The name of this item  - `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `range[array]`: The valid range for the Property in the Resource as an integer.

Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object  - `step[number]`: Step value across the defined range when the range is an integer.  This is the increment for valid values across the range; so if range is 0..10 and step is 2 then valid values are 0,2,4,6,8,10  - `type[string]`: NGSI entity type. It has to be Cadence  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
