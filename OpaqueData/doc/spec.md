version: 0.0.1  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `encoding`: This Property describes the encoding of the payload, e.g. binary as base64, json, xml, utf-8.  - `hash`: The hash code of the blob. If present, it is used to check the decoded content of the object data point for integrity. The algorithm used for generating the hash value is SHA-2 [15]. The data point contains the hash as a hex encoded value.  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `payload`: This Property contains the opaque data.  - `payloadtype`: This Property describes the identification of the payload, e.g. what the payload is representing .  - `rt`: The Resource Type.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `size`: The size in bytes of the decoded binary object.  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `system`: The eco system that is using the payload.  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be OpaqueData    
Required properties  
- `encoding`  - `id`  - `payload`  - `system`  - `type`
