Global description: **This Resource describes Properties associated with air flow.The Property 'supporteddirections' is the set of valid values for the direction property for a particular instance of this Resource Type.The Property 'direction' is the directionality of the air flow if applicable, if Property 'supporteddirections' is also present it must be a value from that set. The values of Property 'direction' are dependent on the capabilities of the unit.The Property 'speed' is an integer representing the current speed level for the unit.The Property 'range' is an array of the min,max values for the speed level. If not present the 'range' defaults to [0,100]. Property 'automode' is the status of the automode feature; Off means automode is not enabled, On means automode is active and the speed is automatically controlled by the Device.**  
version: 0.0.1  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `automode`: The status of the automode feature, if on speed is set by the Device.  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `direction`: The directionality of the air flow, a value indicated by 'supporteddirections'.  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `range`: The valid range for the Property in the Resource as an integer. The first value in the array is the minimum value, the second value in the array is the maximum value.  - `rt`: The Resource Type  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `speed`: The current speed level.  - `step`: Step value across the defined range when the range is an integer.  This is the increment for valid values across the range; so if range is 0..10 and step is 2 then valid values are 0,2,4,6,8,10.  - `supporteddirections`: The array of possible direction settings for this instance of the Resource Type.  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be AirFlow    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `speed`  - `type`
