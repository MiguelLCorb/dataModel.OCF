UVBRadiation:
  description: Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource specifies UV radiation measurement. The Property 'measurement' is the current measured UVB. The intensity of UV radiation is measured in the units of milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2) which is energy per square centimeter received per second. UVB is measured between 280 and 315 nanometers in the electromagnetic spectrum.
