## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified[string]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `hba1c[number]`: Current HbA1c measurement in percentage  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if[array]`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource  - `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n[string]`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name[string]`: The name of this item.  - `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `precision[number]`: When exposed the value in 'precision' provides a +/- tolerance against the Properties in the Resource. Thus if a Property is UPDATED to a value and that Property then RETRIEVED, the RETRIEVED value is valid if in the range of the set value +/- precision  - `range[array]`: The valid range for the Property in the Resource as a number. The first value in the array is the minimum value, the second value in the array is the maximum value.  - `rt[array]`: Resource Type  - `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `step[number]`: Step value across the defined range an integer when the range is a number.  This is the increment for valid values across the range; so if range is 0.0..10.0 and step is 2.5 then valid values are 0.0,2.5,5.0,7.5,10.0.  - `type[string]`: NGSI entity type. It has to be HbA1c  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
