<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified[string]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if[array]`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `impactdirectionhorizontal[number]`: The 'impactdirectionhorizontal' Property shows a horizontal direction where the impact comes from. The value is 0 to 360 degrees. 0 is the front of the sensor and clockwise increment.  - `impactdirectionvertical[number]`: The 'impactdirectionvertical' Property shows a vertical direction where the impact comes from. The value is 0 to 360 degrees. 0 is the front of the sensor and upward increment.  - `impactlevel[number]`: The 'impactlevel' Property provides the level of impact. The unit is in 'G' (G-force).  - `impactstatus[boolean]`: The 'impactstatus' Property indicates the impact as: 'true' A physical impact is detected, 'false' Normal status, an impact is not detected.  - `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n[string]`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name[string]`: The name of this item.  - `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `rt[array]`: The Resource Type.  - `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type[string]`: NGSI entity type. It has to be ImpactSensor  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
