## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `rt`: The Resource Type.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `timestamp`: An RFC3339 formated time indicating when the data was observed (e.g.: 2016-02-15T09:19Z, 1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00).  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be TimeStamp    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `timestamp`  - `type`
