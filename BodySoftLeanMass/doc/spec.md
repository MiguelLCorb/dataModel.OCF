## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `precision`: When exposed the value in 'precision' provides a +/- tolerance against the Properties in the Resource. Thus if a Property is UPDATED to a value and that Property then RETRIEVED, the RETRIEVED value is valid if in the range of the set value +/- precision  - `range`: The valid range for the Property in the Resource as a number. The first value in the array is the minimum value, the second value in the array is the maximum value.  - `rt`: Resource Type  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `slm`: Body soft lean mass.  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `step`: Step value across the defined range an integer when the range is a number.  This is the increment for valid values across the range; so if range is 0.0..10.0 and step is 2.5 then valid values are 0.0,2.5,5.0,7.5,10.0.  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be BodySoftLeanMass  - `units`: Body soft lean mass units    
Required properties
