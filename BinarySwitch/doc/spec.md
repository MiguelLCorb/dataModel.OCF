Global description: **Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource describes a binary switch (on/off). The Property 'value' is a boolean. A value of 'true' means that the switch is on. A value of 'false' means that the switch is off. **  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `rt`: The Resource Type.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be BinarySwitch  - `value`: The status of the switch.    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `type`    
This data model comes from the original [Open Connectivity Foundation repository](https://github.com/openconnectivityfoundation/IoTDataModels). It has been extended to comply with NGSI requirements.

#### BinarySwitch NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a BinarySwitch in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
