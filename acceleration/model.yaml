acceleration:
  description: Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource provides a measure of proper acceleration (g force) as opposed to co-ordinate acceleration (which is dependent on the co-ordinate system and the observer). The Property 'value' is a float which describes the acceleration experienced by the object in 'g'.
