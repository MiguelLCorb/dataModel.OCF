## List of properties    
<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>    
- `acceleration[number]`: The sensed acceleration experienced in 'g'.  - `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)	- `addressCountry[string]`: The country. For example, Spain  . Model: [https://schema.org/addressCountry](https://schema.org/addressCountry)    
	- `addressLocality[string]`: The locality in which the street address is, and which is in the region  . Model: [https://schema.org/addressLocality](https://schema.org/addressLocality)    
	- `addressRegion[string]`: The region in which the locality is, and which is in the country  . Model: [https://schema.org/addressRegion](https://schema.org/addressRegion)    
	- `district[string]`: A district is a type of administrative division that, in some countries, is managed by the local government      
	- `postOfficeBoxNumber[string]`: The post office box number for PO box addresses. For example, 03578  . Model: [https://schema.org/postOfficeBoxNumber](https://schema.org/postOfficeBoxNumber)    
	- `postalCode[string]`: The postal code. For example, 24004  . Model: [https://schema.org/https://schema.org/postalCode](https://schema.org/https://schema.org/postalCode)    
	- `streetAddress[string]`: The street address  . Model: [https://schema.org/streetAddress](https://schema.org/streetAddress)    
	- `streetNr[string]`: Number identifying a specific property on a public street      
- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity  - `dateCreated[date-time]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform  - `dateModified[date-time]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if[array]`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n[string]`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name[string]`: The name of this item  - `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `precision[number]`: When exposed the value in 'precision' provides a +/- tolerance against the Properties in the Resource. Thus if a Property is UPDATED to a value and that Property then RETRIEVED, the RETRIEVED value is valid if in the range of the set value +/- precision  - `range[array]`: The valid range for the Property in the Resource as a number. The first value in the array is the minimum value, the second value in the array is the maximum value.  - `rt[array]`: Resource Type  - `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object  - `step[number]`: Step value across the defined range an integer when the range is a number.  This is the increment for valid values across the range; so if range is 0.0..10.0 and step is 2.5 then valid values are 0.0,2.5,5.0,7.5,10.0.  - `type[string]`: NGSI entity type. It has to be acceleration  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
