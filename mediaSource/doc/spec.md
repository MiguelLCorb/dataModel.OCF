Global description: **Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource defines a single media source that exists on a device. The source can be an input source or output source, this resource is agnostic of that. The Property 'sourceName' specifies a pre-defined media input or output (e.g.'HDMI', 'DVI'). The Property 'sourceNumber' is a label to specify the instance (e.g. 'PC', '1'). The Property 'sourceType' is an enumeration defining whether the source is audio, video or both. The Property 'status' is a boolean that determines if the specific source instance is selected or not.  A status of true means that the source instance is selected.  A status of false means that the source instance is not selected.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `n`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `rt`: The Resource Type.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `sourceName`: Specifies a pre-defined media input or output.  - `sourceNumber`: Label to specify the instance.  - `sourceType`: Specifies the type of the source.  - `status`: Specifies if the specific source instance is selected or not.  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be mediaSource    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `type`    
This data model comes from the original [Open Connectivity Foundation repository](https://github.com/openconnectivityfoundation/IoTDataModels). It has been extended to comply with NGSI requirements.
