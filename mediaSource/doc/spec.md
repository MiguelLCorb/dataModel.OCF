Global description: **Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource defines a single media source that exists on a device. The source can be an input source or output source, this resource is agnostic of that. The Property 'sourceName' specifies a pre-defined media input or output (e.g.'HDMI', 'DVI'). The Property 'sourceNumber' is a label to specify the instance (e.g. 'PC', '1'). The Property 'sourceType' is an enumeration defining whether the source is audio, video or both. The Property 'status' is a boolean that determines if the specific source instance is selected or not.  A status of true means that the source instance is selected.  A status of false means that the source instance is not selected.**
